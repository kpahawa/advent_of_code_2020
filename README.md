# 2020 Advent of Code
____
I decided to participate in the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) this year with some coworkers to solve some fun problems and learn new things. 
These are my solutions to the 2020 AoC.

### Project structure
Each day has its own solutions directory. My big TODO is to put the problem description in each day as well. 
Haven't had the chance to do it yet. I also have a [utils](https://github.com/kpahawa/advent_of_code_2020/tree/main/utils) 
package which contains some utilities that I reuse a lot throughout my solutions. 

### Utils
The most common ones being benchmark tools and input readers for all the day inputs. 

### Running code
All the inputs are already there for each day so each solution should work on its own. The input readers automatically
pick up the proper `inputs` folder when finding the proper day inputs.
